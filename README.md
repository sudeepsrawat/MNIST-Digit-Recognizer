# MNIST-Digit-Recognizer
This project is a Python implementation of a machine learning model that recognizes handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.

# Dependencies
The following dependencies are required to run the project:

Python 3.5+  
NumPy  
Keras  
Matplotlib  

# Dataset
The MNIST dataset is a collection of handwritten digits used for training image processing systems. It consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images, with each image being a 28x28 grayscale image of a handwritten digit.

# Model
The model used in this project is a convolutional neural network (CNN) implemented in Keras. The CNN consists of two convolutional layers followed by two dense layers. 

# Usage  
* To use this project, first clone the repository:  
git clone https://github.com/username/mnist-digit-recognizer.git  
* cd mnist-digit-recognizer
* Next install the required dependencies and packages
* Run the Jupyter Notebook to train the model (you can use more number of epochs). This will generate the model "basemodel.h5"
* Run the app.py file to draw numbers
